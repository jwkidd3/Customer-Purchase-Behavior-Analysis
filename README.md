# Introduction
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior data to identify patterns and trends that can inform marketing strategies and increase offer acceptance rates. By understanding customer demographics, spending habits and preferred purchase modes, the company can optimize its marketing efforts and target the right customers with the right offers.
 
 # Problem Statement
The challenge lies in maximizing customer engagement and offer acceptance through data-driven insights. We need to understand the factors influencing purchase decisions and identify customer segments with high spending potential.

# üìù Project Highlights
- **Basic Cleanup:** Checked for missing, duplicated values and removed outliers.
-  **Feature Engineering:** Feature Engineered 'age' column and 'Total Amount Spent' column to capture more nuances in the analysis.
-  **Descriptive Statistics:** Conducted detailed analysis using measures of central tendency and dispersion to understand customer profiles and spending patterns. Analyzed distribution of customer demographics (age, education, marital status) using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- **Probability Distributions** Utilized hypothesis testing, including the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, to analyze data distributions and infer insights.

# üîë Key Insights
- **Spending by Demographics:** Age and education influence total spending, while age group impacts average spending. Understanding these demographic factors can help tailor marketing strategies effectively.
- **Income and Spending:** Higher income leads to higher total spending. This correlation suggests targeting high-income segments with premium offerings or exclusive discounts.
- **Purchase Modes:** In-store purchases are dominant, with higher offer acceptance rates. Focusing on enhancing in-store experiences and promotions could further boost sales and offer acceptance.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Customer satisfaction is high. Maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction is crucial for retaining customers and fostering loyalty.
- **Product Preferences:** Wines and meat products are top purchases. Stocking and promoting these products effectively can capitalize on customer preferences and drive sales.

# üì∞ Recommendations
- **Targeted Marketing:** Segment customers based on age, education and income. Tailor marketing messages to resonate with specific segments (e.g., premium products for high-income customers, educational-based ads for younger customers).
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Improve in-store experience (layout, customer service) and online experience (personalized recommendations, user interface) to increase customer satisfaction and potentially boost spending.
- **Focus on Top-Selling Categories:** Maintain sufficient stock for popular items (wines, meat) and consider introducing premium versions. Conduct seasonal analysis to anticipate shifts in preferences and introduce new products accordingly.
- **Customer Relationship Management:** Maintain a proactive complaint management system to address customer concerns and build trust. Utilize customer feedback (online and in-store) to identify areas for improvement and showcase positive experiences as testimonials.

# üìú Conclusion
This analysis of customer purchase behavior data provided valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer engagement. By understanding spending habits, preferences and purchase modes, the company can tailor its offerings and create a more customer-centric experience. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of data analysis using descriptive statistics in deriving actionable recommendations to enhance business performance.
